### Big-O Notation


### Task 0

Time complexity for each line is O(1).
Time complexity : O(1)	


### Task 1


Time complexity for iteration within iteration is O(n²)	
Time complexity for checking bool is O(1)
Time complexity for converting list to set : O(n).
Time complexity : O(n²)	



### Task 2

Time complexity for iteration is O(n)	
Time complexity for checking bool is O(1)
Time complexity : O(n)	


### Task 3

Time complexity for iteration is O(n)	
Time complexity for checking bool is O(1)
Time complexity for sorting is O(n log n)
Time complexity : O(n log n)


### Task 4

Time complexity for iteration within iteration (n²)	
Time complexity for checking bool is O(1)
Time complexity for sorting is O(n log n)
Time complexity : O(n²)
